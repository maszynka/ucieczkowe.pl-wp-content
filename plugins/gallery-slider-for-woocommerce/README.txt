## üëâ What Does the WooGallery Mainly Do? ##

‚úÖ **Enable Product Gallery Slider on Product Page**
‚úÖ **Enable Additional Variation Images Gallery Slider**
‚úÖ **Create Product Video Gallery** üî•
‚úÖ **Add Advanced Product Image Zoom** üî•
‚úÖ **Add Advanced Product Image Lightbox**

‚úÖ **Outstanding Product Gallery Slider**

Do you want to boost sales by enhancing your product page design and layout? Do you have too many images of your product?

No worries, **[WooGallery](https://woogallery.io/)** is the perfect solution for you. This fantastic plugin can help you transform WooCommerce's default product gallery into an eye-catching product gallery slider on your product page. By displaying your product and additional variation images in an elegant slider style, you can easily attract more customer attention and increase your sales instantly.

‚úÖ **Additional Variation Images Gallery**

The plugin also allows you to insert unlimited additional images for each variation, letting potential customers see different images when switching between variations. WooCommerce offers an option to insert only one image per product variation. It means there is no option to add more than a single variation image when it is essential to show additional product images to boost sales.

To unlock this limitation, you can use the WooGallery plugin. This plugin allows you to upload multiple images for each product variation. So, by using WooGallery, you can show different sets of images to potential customers when they switch between product variations such as Color, Style, and Size simultaneously.

‚úÖ **Product Video Gallery**

Effortlessly showcase videos alongside product images on your product pages. This plugin lets you embed videos directly into your product image gallery, giving customers a richer, more engaging shopping experience.

When potential customers watch a brief video of your product, the chances of selling it increase, which is an excellent way to market.

‚úÖ **Advanced Product Image Zoom**

Are you looking to improve your customers' shopping experience by allowing them to view your products in more detail and increase sales? The plugin can help you achieve this by providing advanced zooming features for your product images.

This plugin lets your customers get a closer and more detailed look at your products, which can significantly increase customer engagement and generate more sales for your business.

‚úÖ **Powerful Product Image Lightbox**

Do you want your customers to open the larger product image in a full-screen window to look closely at the product details and skyrocket conversions?

The plugin offers exclusively powerful lightbox functionality to open the full-size image in a modal window, allowing your customers to look closely and efficiently at the product details and boost sales.
