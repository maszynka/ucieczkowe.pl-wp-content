== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Send if my website is not connected to WooCommerce? =
> Of course! Send is built for WordPress and designed for WooCommerce to empower you to grow any business with automated marketing campaigns triggered by customers behavior and time based triggers. That being said, you can also use Send to manage your lead generation campaigns, manage and grow your audiences, and broadcast communications like newsletters and more. Send can connect to any website, whether you have WooCommerce installed or not.

= Does my website have to be built using Elementor? =
> Not at all. Send works seamlessly on any WordPress website, whether or not it's built with Elementor. And when it comes to forms, it integrates effortlessly with Elementor Forms as well as other popular builders like WooCommerce, WPForms, and Contact Form 7 — with support for more coming soon.

= Which types of forms can I connect to Send? =
> Currently, Send integrates with Elementor forms. Integration with other popular form builders like Gravity Forms and others is coming soon.

= Can I send emails from my own domain? =
> Yes! With Send's Custom Domain, you can send emails from your own domain (e.g., @yourbrand.com) instead of Send's default domain. This simple setup helps you build trust, improve inbox placement, and increase engagement. You can set your own domain using your DNS credentials to increase email credibility and performance.

= Do I need to link up SMTP to make Send work? =
> No, you don't need to use any SMTP service to make your emails get to your clients' inbox. Send handles delivery without a need to use SMTP.

= How does the Pricing work? =
> Like everything in Send, we kept things simple - Pay as you go. You only pay for the credits you used either for SMS or Email, regardless of the size of your contact list uploaded to Send. Credits are valid for the month they are purchased and do not roll over to the following month. You can modify the number of credits needed on a monthly basis. In the future we will suggest upgrade options.

= How can I report security bugs? =
> You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability](https://patchstack.com/database/wordpress/plugin/send-app/vdp).
